Some initial analysis and brainstorming.

Sisyphus is intended to be essentially a batch and/or worker dispatching system for docker (or other container system).
It's not intended to work like kubernettes...   

Kubernettes doesn't do what I want for a few reasons.

1.  I have a large cluster of NFS disks which I manage.   Kube does this, but I have many dozens of these, which is really a pain to manage with volumes and such in kube.   These end up being "volume profiles", which have security connotations.
2.  I have some fusefs file systems which again are a pain.  They can simply be imported into a container with the -V option.
3.  I can write a big batch of tools that can wrap the operations to control them.
4.  Likely this can run in kube too eventually.
