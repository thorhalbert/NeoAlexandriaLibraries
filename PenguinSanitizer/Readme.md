# Pengin Sanitizer

High level wrapper to make the Tmds.Linux and Tmds.Fuze easier to use.
Start off wrapping certain methods (including some that are missing from Tmds.Linux),
and writing as many extension methods as I can, mostly converting to different needed memory/span
operations.

Most of this stuff is Unsafe.  Has to be. But trying to make it so it's tolerably easy to do 
system-like programming in dotnet and c#.
